**To create an issue, you must be an active supporter of the our community, i.e. a sponsor of NUKE on [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/matkoch)/[OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/nuke)), or greatly involved in any other recognized OSS project. Exception to the rule are high-impact bugs. Also, feature ideas may be discussed openly on [Slack](https://slofile.com/slack/nukebuildnet). Please don't take offense at this, since it is simply a time management decision. However, it is also no guarantee that issues will be resolved or pull-requests will get merged.**
