**To create an issue, you must be either an active sponsor ([GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/matkoch), [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/nuke)) or greatly involved in any other recognized OSS projects. Exception to the rule are high-impact bugs. Also, feature ideas may be discussed openly on [Slack](https://slofile.com/slack/nukebuildnet). Please don't take offense at this, since it is simply a time management decision.**
