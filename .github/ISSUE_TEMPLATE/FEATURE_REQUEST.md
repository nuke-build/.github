**To create a pull-request, you must be an active supporter of our community, i.e., a sponsor of NUKE on [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/matkoch)/[OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/nuke), frequent blogger/mentor, or greatly involved in any other recognized OSS project. High-impact bugs may be reported/fixed at any time, feature ideas may be discussed openly on [Slack](https://slofile.com/slack/nukebuildnet). Please don't take offense at this, particularly when an issue/pull-request is closed with just "see template" as an answer. It is simply a time management decision. Also note, that unless being a bronze/silver/gold sponsor, there is no guarantee as of when an issue or pull-request will be acknowledged or resolved.**
