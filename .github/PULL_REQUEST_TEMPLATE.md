**To create a pull-request, you must be an active supporter of our community, i.e., a sponsor of NUKE on [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/matkoch)/[OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/nuke)), or greatly involved in any other recognized OSS project. High-impact bugs may be reported/fixed at any time, feature ideas may be discussed openly on [Slack](https://slofile.com/slack/nukebuildnet). Please don't take offense at this, particularly when an issue/pull-request is closed with just "see template" as an answer. It is simply a time management decision. Also note, that unless being a bronze/silver/gold sponsor, there is no guarantee as of when an issue or pull-request will be acknowledged or resolved.**

Force-pushes may happen on develop branch (due to the nature of testing CI features). You can rebase and drop commits that do not belong to you. Otherwise, we will drop them manually when merging. Do NOT merge develop into your branch at any time!

I confirm that the pull-request:

- [ ] Follows the contribution guidelines
- [ ] Is based on my own work
