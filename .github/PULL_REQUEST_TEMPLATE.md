**To create an issue, you must be either an active sponsor ([GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/matkoch), [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/nuke)) or greatly involved in any other recognized OSS projects. Exception to the rule are high-impact bugs. Also, feature ideas may be discussed openly on [Slack](https://slofile.com/slack/nukebuildnet). Please don't take offense at this, since it is simply a time management decision.**

Force-pushes may happen on develop branch (due to the nature of testing CI features). You can rebase and drop commits that do not belong to you. Otherwise, we will drop them manually when merging. Do NOT merge develop into your branch at any time!
